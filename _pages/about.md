<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a M.Sc. student at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) <img src='images/logo_UCAS.png' style='width: 1.1em;'> ([Ranking NO.112 in US.News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences)), and doing my research at [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://english.cas.cn/). I am now working in the CUHK@MMLAB in Shenzhen named [SIAT-MMLAB](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), which was founded and directed by Professor [Xiaoou Tang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~0017056?language=en), Yu Qiao, and Chao Dong. I received my B.E. degree from [Nanjing University (NJU)]([https://english.ucas.ac.cn/](https://www.nju.edu.cn/)) <img src='images/logo_NJU.png' style='width: 1.1em;'> ([Ranking NO.73 in THE, NO.123 in US.News, and NO.121 in QS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University)), Nanjing, China in 2021. 

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and image enhancement. Recently, I have focused on AIGC, low-level tasks, image editing, image generation, video generation, and 3D generation. I have explored AIGC methods such as Diffusion Models for a long time (from 2022.7 to now). I work on designing new kinds of Diffusion Models and their applications for various fields, aiming to promote the efficiency and flexibility of Diffusion Models used in the real world. I am now an IEEE member, ACM member, IEEE SPS member and CCF member. **I have served as a reviewer many times for top conferences such as NeurIPS (2024), ICCV (2023), ECCV (2024), ACM MM (2024), ICME (2024), ICMR (2024), and MMM (2023).**

> 📢📢📢 <font color=red>I am looking for more close friends in research.</font> If you would like to discuss AIGC or diffusion models with me, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:jc.huang@siat.ac.cn). 😊

My first mentor is Shifeng Chen and my second mentor is [Chao Dong](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~chaodong). Our Lab is directed by Professor [Xiaoou Tang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~0017056?language=en) and [Yu Qiao](https://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao). I also work with my coauthors such as [Donghao Zhou](https://correr-zhou.github.io/), [Chaoqi Chen](https://chaoqichen.github.io/), Yifan Liu, Jaixi Lv, Yi Huang, [Wei Xiong](https://wxiong.me/), [He Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/hezhangsprinter/), [Liangliang Cao](http://llcao.net/), [Yizhou Yu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~yzyu/), and [Jianzhuang Liu](https://teacher.ucas.ac.cn/~jzliu#%20191067).
