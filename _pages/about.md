<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a research engineer at MM of Meituan Inc. I was a M.Sc. student at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) <img src='images/logo_UCAS.png' style='width: 1.1em;'> ([Ranking NO.69 in US.News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences)), and did my research at [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://english.cas.cn/). I worked in the CUHK@MMLAB in Shenzhen named [SIAT-MMLAB](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), which was founded and directed by Professor [Xiaoou Tang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~0017056?language=en), Yu Qiao, and Chao Dong. I received my B.E. degree from [Nanjing University (NJU)]([https://english.ucas.ac.cn/](https://www.nju.edu.cn/)) <img src='images/logo_NJU.png' style='width: 1.1em;'> ([Ranking NO.65 in THE, NO.98 in US.News, and NO.121 in QS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University)), Nanjing, China in 2021. My undergraduate and graduate universities are both ranked among the top 100 universities in the world.

My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and image enhancement. Recently, I have focused on AIGC, low-level tasks, image editing, image generation, video generation, and 3D generation. I have explored AIGC methods such as Diffusion Models for a very long time (from 2022.7 to now). I work on designing new kinds of Diffusion Models and their applications for various fields, aiming to promote the efficiency and flexibility of Diffusion Models used in the real world. I am now an IEEE member, ACM member, IEEE SPS member and CCF member. **I have been invited and served as a reviewer many times for top conferences or journals such as NeurIPS (2024), ICLR (2025), ICCV (2023), ECCV (2024), ACM MM (2024), WACV (2025), ICME (2024), AISTATS (2025), ICMR (2024), Neural Networks (many times), and MMM (2023).**

> 📢📢📢 <font color=red>I am looking for more close friends in research.</font> If you would like to discuss AIGC or diffusion models with me, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:jc.huang@siat.ac.cn). 😊

My first mentor is Shifeng Chen and my second mentor is [Chao Dong](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~chaodong). Our Lab is directed by Professor [Xiaoou Tang](https://people.ucas.edu.cn/~0017056?language=en) and [Yu Qiao](https://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao). I also work with my coauthors such as [Donghao Zhou](https://correr-zhou.github.io/), [Chaoqi Chen](https://chaoqichen.github.io/), [Lin Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DAn1pA4AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Wei Xiong](https://wxiong.me/), [He Zhang](https://sites.google.com/site/hezhangsprinter/), [Liangliang Cao](http://llcao.net/), [Pheng Ann Heng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OFdytjoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Zequn Jie](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4sKGNB0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Yizhou Yu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~yzyu/), and [Jianzhuang Liu](https://teacher.ucas.ac.cn/~jzliu#%20191067). **Xiaoou Tang, Chao Dong, Yu Qiao, Liangliang Cao, Pheng Ann Heng, Yizhou Yu, and Jianzhuang Liu are World's Top 2% Scientists of Lifetime Impact Ranking.**
