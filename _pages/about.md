<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a M.Sc. student at [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) <img src='images/logo_UCAS.png' style='width: 1.1em;'> ([learn more about UCAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences)), and doing my research at [Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology (SIAT)](https://english.siat.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://english.cas.cn/). I am now working in the ShenZhen Key Lab of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. I received my B.E. degree from the Nanjing University, Nanjing, China
in 2021. 


My research interests include deep learning, computer vision, and image enhancement. Recently, I have focused on low-level tasks such as low-light image enhancement, defocus, deraining and real image denoising. In addition, I have explored AIGC methods such as VAE, VQVAE, and Diffusion Models for a long time (from 2022.7 to now). I work on designing new kinds of Diffusion Models and their applications for various fields, aiming to promote the efficiency and flexibility of Diffusion Models used in the real world.

> 📢📢📢 <font color=red>I am looking for research internships and Ph.D. positions.</font> If you would like to discuss potential opportunities or learn more about my qualifications, please feel free to [contact me](mailto:jc.huang@siat.ac.cn). 😊

My first mentor is Shifeng Chen and my second mentor is [Chao Dong](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~chaodong). I also work with my coauthors such as [Donghao Zhou](https://correr-zhou.github.io/), [Chaoqi Chen]([https://correr-zhou.github.io/](https://chaoqichen.github.io/)), Yifan Liu, Jaixi Lv, Yi Huang, and [Jianzhuang Liu](https://teacher.ucas.ac.cn/~jzliu#%20191067).
